## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM class naming methodology
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've learned a new css trick to set the semi-transparent color layer over the image from this [stack overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9182978/semi-transparent-color-layer-over-background-image) which utilizes the 'box-shadow' property like so:

```css
box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1000px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
```

I didn't end up using it as I've made some changes to my code that required me to use a different way to achieve this.

### Continued development

I think I need to learn more about embedding images in HTML & CSS and making them responsive as I struggle everytime with images.
